aka command+tab but for Safari

### Features:
- Switching tab history navigation with Option+Tab (or set your own shortcut);
- Tab search;
- Customizable shortcut;
- Dark mode, light mode;
- Does not ask for permission to read "webpage content". Permission to access "browsing history" is only used to display tab titles;
- Written entirely in Swift. Not a single line of JS;
- Works even when tabs are loading and on empty and history pages;
- Open source. Which means 100% transparency;
- Gorgeous design;
- Almost native experience;

### Motivation:
Switching between apps with command+tab is my favorite way of navigating between apps.
One day i realized that it would tremendously simplify web navigation if such a way would exist in Safari.

There are similar apps, but i decided to make my own, which unlike of other similar extensions would
- Be open-source;
- Be written entirely in Swift;
- Be easy to set up and use;
- Have convenient search;
- Have a beautiful design.

### Here is a video demo on how it works:

Currently the app was purchased by 10 users.
I'm happily working on new updates for them.
